           <p> SwifNet offers a core messaging service (FIN) which standardizes message types between the members of its network. Companies can use this messaging service to transmit data back and forth with their banks. Common message types include MT103 (credit transfer), MT940 (account statement), and MX pain. SWIFT payments work by facilitating secure, standardized communication between banks for international money transfers.  </p>
